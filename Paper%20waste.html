        <h1> Paper waste </h1>
<p> Worldwide, over 95 million metric tonnes of paper are recovered each year to be made into recycled paper and paperboard. According to Environment Canada, of the 6 million tonnes of paper and paperboard used annually, only 25% of them are recycled; paper waste accounts for more than 1/3 of all wastes in the country.<br><br>
    
Paper Waste is a severe problem in many industries and offices. Because of printing mistakes, junk mails, billings, and packaging, the paper may comprise up to 70% of a company’s total waste. An average office employee would be using about 10,000 sheets of paper in a year. In addition to paper used for printing, companies also consume other paper products, such as cardboard, envelopes, and wrappers, to name a few.

        <h1> Impact of Paper Waste</h1>
<p>With much of the attention focused on plastic disposal, the impact of paper waste is often overlooked. Yet, improper paper waste disposal and recycling can impact the economy and the environment as the other waste products.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> 40% of all traded industrial wood in the world is reserved for pulp and paper industries, which produce office paper, tissue, and paper-based packaging. Deforestation is detrimental to the ecosystem as loss of habitat can lead to flora and fauna extinction. While many industries have committed to reforestation projects, these artificial forests are often unsustainable and unable to support biodiversity.</li> </ul>

<h1>Paper Waste Management</h1>
<p>With the proper reduction of waste and recycling methods, the economic and environmental benefits are tremendous. However, whether you are at home, in an office, or a big industry, paper waste is something that should not be taken for granted. It’s time paper-dependent companies should try to sort waste correctly or risk the cost of inefficient management and utilization of paper.</p>
